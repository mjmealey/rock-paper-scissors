# rock-paper-scissors

This is a new take on the rock paper scissors project I completed prior. I am somewhat passionate about vikings thanks to some bands I've discovered so I decided to build a rock paper scissors game, but with a viking theme. I had an absolute blast making this and I plan on returning to it to make it even better and more in depth as I get more knowledgeable in html, css and javascript.
